# DOTNET-RPG
A simple project to study .NET Core, Entity Framework, and its uses. In particular,
Integration with SQL Express (EF) with the use of DbSets and DTOs,
Authentication with Json Web Tokens,
and core practices like Services, CRUD oprations, design patterns, async and Task usage, etc.

# The actual project
This training-project is about creating a server-side, UI-less / minimal assets for a simple turn-based RPG game. Where each user creates one or more characters, and can set it against someone else's character, albeit in a very simplistic, simulated manner.
